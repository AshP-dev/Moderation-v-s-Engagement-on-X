Social media platforms regularly censor and flag posts that violate certain policies. The policies in
question may be policies of the platform itself, or certain governments across the world. Social media
platforms have strict policies when it comes to posts engaging in misinformation or hate speech not only
to protect their users, but also to ensure that advertisers do not leave the platform. Additionally, these
platforms also have to flag or censor certain posts to adhere to the rules of the country in which the
platform is active. Not adhering to the rules of world governments and judicial systems can result in the
platform being entirely banned in a certain country, costing the platform millions of users and advertising
revenue from that area.
The entire purpose of censoring or flagging a post on social media - the reason why so many countries
have lately paid special attention to this issue - is to severely limit its reach and the number of people that
see the post. Social media platforms also want to crank down on posts with misinformation or hate speech
for this reason, so that the posts reach will be limited and the number of people that believe the
information will be minimized. Otherwise, there may be a case when posts spreading wild misinformation
and hate speech take over a platform, resulting in advertisers pulling out and serious investigations into a
platform’s management.
So can it really be factually stated that censoring or flagging certain posts actually results in reduced
spread? And because policies on content moderation and censorship vary so much throughout the world,
we will provide comparative analysis across countries to see how moderation policies impact retweet
behavior using visualizations and ratings of country-specific moderation policies based on their alignment
with public sentiment, helping users determine if a country's policy is too strict or too lenient.
And even when a platform does limit the reach of the post in an extremely strict way that prevents any
interaction with the post, does that post really stop spreading? What prevents the users from discussing it
without interacting with the post directly - whether it’s on the same platform, or another platform? How
does the reach of a flagged or censored post differ when the user is a person with a massive following vs
if the user is a common person? In the case of smaller accounts, even if the exact posts by smaller
accounts are censored and limited, are there still widespread discussions across platforms regarding the
same topic as what the original users were posting about?
